# 🇿🇲 Zambia Mining Audit: Data Activism Tool

A specialized document parser built to audit the **Mines and Minerals Development (Amendment) Act, 2016**. This tool extracts fiscal terms and royalty structures to increase transparency in natural resource governance.

- **High-Value Minerals**: Flagging 6% flat rates for gemstones.
- **Accountability Clauses**: Identifying "Arm's Length" transaction rules.
